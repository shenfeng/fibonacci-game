# fibonacci game

A fibonacci game for few languages, just for fun.

C/Clojure/go/python/nodejs/JAVA calculate fibonacci(40)
recursively, record the total time and fibonacci(40) time.

This benchmark the language's function call speed. Fibonacci(40) has a
total of 331160281 function calls.

![Performance comparison chart](https://github.com/shenfeng/fibonacci-game/raw/master/pic.png)

* C is the fatest
* Nodejs's function call is very efficient
* Go's function call is very efficient
* Java startups slower compared to C/go/python
* Clojure startups slow, but runs quite fast
* Python runs relatively slow, but startups quite fast
